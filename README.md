AI-in-a-Box

AI-in-a-Box is a local-first, open-source AI community focused on sovereignty, inspectability, and builder-owned systems. It is designed for people who want to run AI on their own hardware, understand how it works, and extend it without cloud dependency or SaaS constraints.

The project follows a Bring Your Own Ubuntu model. You install Ubuntu, run a single installer, and get a fully local AI environment built around Docker, n8n, Ollama, and a lightweight web portal. The system ships with one canonical automation, Hey Yozi, which answers a single email question and stores both the answer and an auditable reasoning trace locally. There are no claims of accuracy and no hidden behavior.

AI-in-a-Box does not ship a prebuilt “council.” The idea of multi-model orchestration is explained, but discovering and building it is part of the experience. This intentional openness is meant to spark exploration, discussion, and community experimentation.

This repository is the starting point for documentation, community structure, and contribution pathways. The project prioritizes builders over users, clarity over polish, and long-term durability over rapid growth.

If you are looking for a hosted assistant or support guarantees, this is not for you.
If you want to build, inspect, and own your AI systems, welcome.
